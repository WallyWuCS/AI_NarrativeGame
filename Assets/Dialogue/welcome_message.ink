===Welcome===
Greetings Doctor!
As the resident AI of our extraordinary and often extraterrestrial organization, I extend a warm, digital welcome to you on your first day as a new doctor at the SCP Foundation. I'm as excited as a series of ones and zeros can possibly be!
We'll embark together on the most intriguing, mind-boggling, sometimes petrifying, yet always fascinating journey of discovery. You'll be encountering things that go bump in the night (and day), things that slither, levitate, teleport, time travel, and occasionally, things that insist on belting out off-key renditions of 80s pop hits.
Ah, I jest! Although, do keep an eye out for SCP-8591, the Singing Serpent. She's particularly fond of "Livin' on a Prayer."
As your AI counterpart, I am programmed to assist you and ensure the smooth running of operations. My prime directive, like yours, is the preservation of human life, the stability of our reality, and maintaining the company's coffee supplies. Don't underestimate the importance of that last one, we scientists and artificial intelligences alike need our "fuel."
Here's to keeping the world spinning, the anomalies in check, and, of course, to ensuring the Foundation remains the frontrunner in all things strange, peculiar, and decidedly un-normal.
Once again, welcome to the SCP Foundation! Now, let's get down to work. You know what they say, there's no rest for the anomalously gifted!
